# Hello!
This is a dedicated repository for a project on segmenting informal settlements using the Segment Anything Model, developed in the context of my Master's thesis.

The repository houses a data set collected in patches, to be used for model fine-tuning.
Code examples are presented in the form of notebooks. These notebooks constitute illustrative examples, as data will need to be accessed in the users own directories.
Finally, the model used to perform analyses is featured as a .pth file.
