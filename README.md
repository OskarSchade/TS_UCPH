# Hello!
This is a dedicated repository for a project on segmenting informal settlements using the Segment Anything Model, developed in the context of my Master's thesis.

The repository houses a data set of images and masks collected in patches, to be used for model fine-tuning or testing. The masks are binary images, wherefore, they may not appear as intended if not loaded correctly.
Code examples are presented in the form of notebooks. These notebooks constitute illustrative examples rather than fully functional code, as data will need to be accessed in the users own designated directories.
Finally, the model which has been developed and used to perform analyses is featured as a .pth file.

I refrain from providing further details on the project here, as the thesis is yet to be evaluated.

Once the project has been finalized formally, I hope to also house the full thesis here.
